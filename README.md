# Golub_dataset_Class_Prediction_Python

This repository houses an analysis of the famous Golub dataset, using a couple different classifiers.
The analysis was done in Python using scikit-learn.
To use the notebook (file that ends with .ipynb), first install the environment with conda:
conda create --name Golub_py --file environment.txt

this will create an environment named Golub_py.

Open a command prompt/ terminal/ shell in the directory into which you cloned this repository.

If you are on Windows, to activate the environment, you type:
activate Golub_py

On a Mac or Linux, to activate the environment, you type:
source activate Golub_py

Now to open the notebook, simply type:
jupyter notebook

--> a tab will open in your browser from which you can simply select the Jupyter Notebook and now you can run and modify it in your browser.
